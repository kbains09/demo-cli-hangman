# hangman_python
Building a simple hangman game in python.
The goal of this project is to gain a stronger understanding of python functions and how to use it to build a simple game.

To run the game, in your terminal, type: python3 hangman.py (or python hangman.py if you are using python 2.7). You will be prompted to enter a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you will lose a life. You have 6 lives. If you guess the word before you lose all your lives, you win. If not, you lose.
